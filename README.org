* Introduction
This is an *emacs* frontend to interact with Squeezebox Server / Logitech Media Server.
Released under GPL version 3 license or later.

It requires emacs version 25 or higher.

More information on what a *squeezebox controller* is at https://inigo.katxi.org/blog/2017/07/31/lms_el.html.

Quick instructions: customize some basic parameters such as 'lms-url' and run it with *lms* or *lms-ui*.
From there, you could read complete documentation after pressing *h* key.
You can also run *emacsclient -e "(lms-float)"* to display an independent small frame.


Package should appear in [[https://melpa.org][MELPA repository]], and the code is in [[https://hg.serna.eu/emacs/lms][the code repository]] as well.

* Features
This is Squeezebox controller, i.e. a program which can handle your local music library.

Some of the features:
- Display song: title, artist, album, year, cover…
- Play, pause, stop, select next / previous song
- Control players: select player, power on/off, volume, repeat and shuffle modes
- Playlist control: list, select song, delete track, clear
- Show track information and change rating

It is not aimed to be a complete controller, as it can't - and won't - manage external sources such us BBC, Deezer, Pandora, Spotify, or TuneIn Radio.
