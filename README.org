* Introduction
This is an *emacs* frontend to interact with Squeezebox Server / Logitech Media Server.
Released under GPL version 3 license or later.

It requires emacs version 25 or higher.

More information on what a *squeezebox controller* is at https://inigo.katxi.org/blog/2017/07/31/lms_el.html.

Quick instructions: customize some basic parameters 'lms-hostname', 'lms-telnet-port', 'lms-html-port', 'lms-username', 'lms-password' and run it with *lms-ui*.
From there, you could read complete documentation after pressing *h* key.

Package should appear in [[https://melpa.org][MELPA repository]], and the code is in [[https://bitbucket.com/inigoserna/lms.el][BitBucket code repository]] as well.

* Features
This is Squeezebox controller, i.e. a program which can handle your local music library.

Some of the features:
- Display song: title, artist, album, year, cover…
- Play, pause, stop, select next / previous song
- Control players: select player, power on/off, volume, repeat and shuffle modes
- Playlist control: list, select song, delete track, clear
- Show track information and change rating

It is not aimed to be a complete controller, as it can't - and won't - manage external sources such us BBC, Deezer, Pandora, Spotify, or TuneIn Radio.

* Configuration
There are some parameters you could customize:
|------------------------+---------------------------------------+----------|
| Parameter              | Description                           | Default  |

| lms-hostname           | Logitech Media Server hostname or ip  | hostname |
| lms-telnet-port        | Logitech Media Server telnet port     | 9090     |
| lms-html-port          | Logitech Media Server www port        | 80       |
| lms-username           | Logitech Media Server username or nil | nil      |
| lms-password           | Logitech Media Server password or nil | nil      |
| lms-default-player     | Name of default player                | nil      |

| lms-ui-update-interval | Time in seconds between UI updates    | nil      |
|------------------------+---------------------------------------+----------|
Notes:
(1) If *lms-default-player* is not defined or a player with that name does not exist, it will ask for one at start.
(2) It's recomendable not to change *lms-ui-cover-width*.
(3) Note that small values in *lms-ui-update-interval* could freeze your Emacs use while refreshing window.
